        1) Padding is only placed on the top and/or bottom of the divs. The elements within these divs have padding on their sides. This saves you from any "box model math". Keep in mind, if you add any side padding or border to the div itself, it will be added to the width you define to create the *total* width. You may also choose to remove the padding on the element in the div and place a second div within it with no width and the padding necessary for your design.

        2) No margin has been given to the columns since they are all floated. If you must add margin, avoid placing it on the side you're floating toward (for example: a right margin on a div set to float right). Many times, padding can be used instead. For divs where this rule must be broken, you should add a "display:inline" declaration to the div's rule to tame a bug where some versions of Internet Explorer double the margin.

        3) Since classes can be used multiple times in a document (and an element can also have multiple classes applied), the columns have been assigned class names instead of IDs. For example, two sidebar divs could be stacked if necessary. These can very easily be changed to IDs if that's your preference, as long as you'll only be using them once per document.

        4) If you prefer your nav on the right instead of the left, simply float these columns the opposite direction (all right instead of all left) and they'll render in reverse order. There's no need to move the divs around in the HTML source.

						Accurate tooth identification and delineation in dental CBCT images are essential in clinical oral diagnosis and treatment.
						Teeth are positioned in the alveolar bone in a particular order, featuring similar appearances across adjacent and bilaterally symmetric teeth.
						However, existing tooth segmentation methods ignored such specific anatomical topology,  which hampers the segmentation accuracy.
						Here we propose a semantic graph-based method to explicitly model the spatial associations between different anatomical targets (i.e., teeth) for their precise delineation in a coarse-to-fine fashion.
						First, to efficiently control the bilaterally symmetric confusion in segmentation, we employ a lightweight network to roughly separate teeth as four quadrants.
						Then, designing a semantic graph attention mechanism to explicitly model the anatomical topology of the teeth in each quadrant, based on which voxel-wise discriminative feature embeddings are learned for the accurate delineation of teeth boundaries.
						Extensive experiments on a clinical dental CBCT dataset demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method compared with other state-of-the-art approaches.
